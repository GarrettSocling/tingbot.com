  <h1>Tingbot Code of Conduct</h1>

  <p>
    Tingbot is dedicated to a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone. If you're taking part in our online community (e.g. our GitHub, Slack), you're required to abide by this code of conduct.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simply put: be considerate, don't be mean, and respect your fellow Tingbotters.
  </p>

  <p>For the avoidance of doubt, examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments</li>
    <li>Personal attacks</li>
    <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery</li>
    <li>The use of offensive language (remember some of our users are children)</li>
    <li>Public or private harassment</li>
    <li>Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission</li>
    <li>Other unethical or unprofessional conduct</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Tingbot core team have the right to edit/remove any posts, code, or other contributions that don't align with this code of conduct, and potentially ban any contributor that is repeatedly violating.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the core team at <b>hello at tingbot dot com</b>.
