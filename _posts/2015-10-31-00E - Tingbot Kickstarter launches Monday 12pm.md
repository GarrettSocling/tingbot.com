Hello!

Who’d have thought it, we’ve finished our Kickstarter video and our campaign page has been approved!

We wanted to share the good news and give you a heads up for our big launch on **MONDAY 2nd NOVEMBER** at **12pm (GMT)**

We’d like to thank you for rallying behind Tingbot and in return you are the first to know when we're going live.

Tingbot has had some great feedback over the past few days. In the run up to our launch we took one along to the Hardware Coffee Morning in Shoreditch.

It was great fun sharing Tingbot with everyone there and we received some awesome feedback and great tips for the coming weeks.

So the countdown is on. We can't wait to kickstart Tingbot and hope you can't either - see you on launch day!
