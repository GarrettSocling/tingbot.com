Faithful backers, thank you. We just cleared our first milestone - in only 36 hours we've funded 25% of our project!

It's been a busy couple of days since we launched. We were chosen as a Kickstarter Staff Pick, featured on Product Hunt, seen loads of activity on Twitter... we're all new to this Kickstarter thing so it's been really exciting!

We've still got a fair way to go, so if you have a Raspberry Pi-loving friend that you think might enjoy Tingbot, send them our way. The more the merrier!
