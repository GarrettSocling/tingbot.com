## ...we smashed our funding goal!

We have 5 very happy chappys in the Tingbot camp, who can’t thank our 744 backers enough! With a little less than 3 days to go we hit our 40k target, sailed past it, and landed on a whopping £48.560. Wow.


## Go Go Go

Now that we are funded, we can push the button and bring Tingbot to life. We have already begun post-campaign discussions with our manufacturers about production time-frames and everything is looking really good. We’ll keep you updated when we have more to share!


## Woohoo! When can I pick my Tingbot style?

A few of you have messaged about when you can choose your colour. We’ll be sending out a survey in the New Year, collecting any details required to get your favourite Tingbot style delivered to your door. Don’t worry! We’ll give plenty notice :)

## Card problems

We have just over a week to wait while funds are collected and transferred. Thanks to all those who have got in touch so far to sort out any payment issues.

There are about 40 of you still having problems. If this sounds like you, Kickstarter will have sent you an email (check your spam folder just in case) and I have emailed you individually with help on how to resolve this. Please don’t delay as there is only a few days left until Kickstarter will drop these pledges - we don’t want anyone missing out on a spanking new Tingbot!

## I missed it! Can I still get a Tingbot?

Currently, our number 1 priority is getting Tingbot into the hands of our backers, so any further orders are on hold for now. If you’d like to be first to know when Tingbot will be available for preorder, you can sign up to our mailing list [here](//store.tingbot.com) and we’ll keep you in the loop!

If you have any questions in the meantime, message us on [Kickstarter](//www.kickstarter.com/projects/744235676/tingbot-raspberry-pi-made-fun), [Twitter](//twitter.com/thetingbot), [Facebook](//www.facebook.com/thetingbot) or [email](//mailto:hello@tingbot.com/).
