Hello Tingfans,

We are now half way through our campaign - what a ride! We hit **50% funding** on Friday before **reaching 60% by the end of the weekend!**

Thank you for all the support so far - for backing and for sharing. We couldn’t do what we’re doing without you guys. We’ve been trying some new things with Tingbot over the last few days so without further ado, on with the update…


## If This Then That

Joe has been busy this week setting up Tingbot to receive data from [If This Then That](//ifttt.com/) using the brand-new webhooks. In the above video you can learn how to make an app to display SMS messages in just 12 lines of code. What a guy!

We're aiming to make regular videos to show the wide range of things you can do using Tingbot and Tide. If you have any comments or suggestions for content we’d love to hear them.


## Teaching Tingbot

Armed with a couple of Tingbots, Ben and Phil phil travelled to Cumbria to visit their old high school, Caldew, before heading on to Glasgow School of Art. On the trip they presented to Design & Technology and Product Design students about the process we have gone through with Tingbot from initial idea to live campaign. Stay tuned for a full update in the next few days!


## It’s ‘Appening

This week we will be launching our first version of the Tingbot app store where you can download some of our sample apps and try them out in [Tide](//github.com/tingbot/tide/releases) and the Tingbot Simulator. Now is your chance to start making and submitting your own apps if you haven’t already done so! If you have an app that you want to share or let others try out, email them through to **hello at tingbot dot com** and we will post them to the store.

**Exciting stuff, I’m sure you’ll agree!** We’re getting close so please share the campaign with as many people as you can. We want to make Tingbot a reality and with your help we can get there.

’Til next time!
