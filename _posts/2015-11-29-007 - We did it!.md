##We have reached our goal of 40K!

** ヽ(´▽`)/**

It’s hard to put into words what this means for us. The Tingbot Team can’t thank you all enough! Each and every one of you who has backed, shared or spread the word about Tingbot…**YOU’RE AWESOME!**

It’s been an incredible journey for us so far. We are so excited to set the production wheels in motion and get Tingbot into your hands!


## What a week

It has been a busy last few days for us here at Tingbot HQ, doing all we can to get it over the line - and there is still 64 hours remaining :)

Last weekend we attended [#CGJam](//twitter.com/hashtag/cgjam) at Dragon Hall Tech Hub for their birthday event - thanks to [Frank](//twitter.com/fth_nix) and the team for having us, it was great to be part of the day.

On Tuesday, we packed up our Tingbots and took the over to the [London IOT Meetup](//https://twitter.com/iotlondon) where Ben gave a talk about all things Tingbot & Pi (followed by beer and demos - the perfect combo!)

We were honoured this week to have a wee feature in [The MagPi Magazine issue 40](//www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/issues/40/), alongside the incredible Raspberry Pi Zero. If you managed to miss us in the excitement of the launch, you can flick to pg.93

Thursday and Friday were also big days funding wise, making it as both **Project of the Day on Kickstarter** and [featured in TechCrunch](//techcrunch.com/2015/11/27/tingbot/), raising Tingbot spirits even higher!


## One last push

The campaign is still not over! We have another 64 hours left and we’d love to see some buzz about Tingbot on Twitter and Facebook in the closing stages. **Please Tweet and Share and we’ll see you back here for the official close!**
