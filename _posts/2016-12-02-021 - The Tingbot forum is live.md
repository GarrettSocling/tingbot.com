Hello Tingtroops,

It’s been a couple of months since your Tingbots have arrived and we thought what better way to start the community off than with [our very own forum](//forum.tingbot.com/) :)

The new forum will be the go-to place where you can **share your apps, discuss ideas, troubleshoot, collaborate on projects** and show off anything else Tingbot related.

There are already some exciting projects appearing on the forum that started life on our [slack channel](//slack.tingbot.com/). Joerick has given a tasty [apps roundup](//forum.tingbot.com/topic/37/tasty-apps-roundup) of projects that have caught our eye from our app store - [The Tingbot Ocean](//ocean.tingbot.com/).

Some skunkworks projects have also appeared - using the Tingbot device for other purposes such as running your [Tingbot as a retro-gaming machine with RetroPie](//forum.tingbot.com/topic/4/tingbot-with-emulationstation-and-retropie) and [using the Tingbot in NodeJS](//forum.tingbot.com/topic/42/using-the-tingbot-in-nodejs-with-tingbot-node-on-raspbian).

So what are you waiting for? **[Join the fun!](//forum.tingbot.com/)
