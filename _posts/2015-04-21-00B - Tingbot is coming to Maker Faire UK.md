Hello Tingbot faithful,

We've been fairly radio silent since the Elephant & Castle Mini Maker Faire - and for good reason!

Our [new website](//tingbot.com/) should give you an idea about what we've achieved so far and our ambitions going forward.

We've spent the past few months creating an even better [Tingbot](//vimeo.com/117383761) in time for [Maker Faire UK](//www.makerfaireuk.com/makers/meet-the-makers/tingbot/) this weekend in Newcastle.

We're very excited about some of the cool new features we'll be demonstrating and we think you will be too.

If you are planning on attending the show, **please come and say hello**! If not, watch this space - there will be more updates to follow over the summer and we are keen to involve you more in the development process.

Many thanks,

*- The Tingbot Team*
