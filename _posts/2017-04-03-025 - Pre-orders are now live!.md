## Folks, the shop is finally open again!

Tingbot is soaring into phase 2 of production after the delivery of our Kickstarter units a few months ago. That means that any of you who have been waiting to get your hands on your favourite ‘bot will be able to pre-order yours today from our [online store](//store.tingbot.com/).

Expected delivery for all orders is June, so head on over to store.tingbot.com and select your Tingbot style :)


## Maker Faire Madness

We are just back from a weekend up in Newcastle at [Maker Faire UK](//www.makerfaireuk.com/) to celebrate the launch of our store. Take a peek at the stall below if you didn’t manage to make it along:
