It’s been a long ol’ journey but Tingbot is finally just around the corner! 

We’ve been extremely busy tying together the loose ends since the last update so here’s the lowdown…

The first big piece of news is that all the boxes are ticked and we are going to begin shipping Tingbots to you guys **early September** ヽ(^。^)丿

In the next couple of weeks we will be posting further updates about specific stages of the manufacturing process, but for now here’s a summary what’s happened since last time.


## From the caps..

We’ve received a whole host of samples from the mould as you can see above ^^ The finish is looking beautiful and with our final adjustments and choice of finish made, we are ready to push the button and get these injected!

The side caps are going to be produced this **Thursday 18th August**. We are going to take the trip North and plan to spend the afternoon at the factory filming the process to give you an insight into injection moulding in the UK.

## ..to the wraps

Ben is currently at [Cut Laser Cut](//www.cutlasercut.com/) finalising the cutting file and testing with the new Priplak sheets we’ve had delivered. After the perfect cut is primed these will be going into production - keep an eye on the twitter feed today for picture updates!

## From China with love

The completed screen module and button board samples have been received, finalised and the full run is underway. The shipment is expected in the next 2 weeks (eek!) and we’ll be posting more pictures as we get ‘em :)

## Let there be light

With the new backlight control on the latest factory samples, Joe’s been doing some fancy stuff to make the backlight as even as possible…. check out those curves!

## Lookin' Tide-y

Joes also been working away on [Tide](//github.com/tingbot/tide-electron), getting our full cross-platform version ready before we ship. Fantastic progress has been made and we couldn’t have done it without our open-source team. There are a couple of things that still need ticked off before launch, so if you feel you can contribute head on over to our [Slack channel](//slack.tingbot.com/).

We can’t wait to see what you’ll be making with Tingbot come September so please remember to **tweet and email your creations** to us.

Thanks for your patience. It’s going to be an exciting few weeks - we’re glad to have you aboard!
