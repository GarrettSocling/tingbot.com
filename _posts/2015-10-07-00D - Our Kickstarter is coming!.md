Hello Tingbot troops!

It’s been a wee while since our last mail and we’d like to share some exciting news with you... **we’ve started filming our Kickstarter campaign!**

This means we’re within a few weeks of going live and you’ll finally have the chance to get your hands on your very own [Tingbot](//tingbot.com/).

We think Kickstarter will be the best way to reach the makers and creators who will help make Tingbot a reality. And we hope you will join us on this journey.


##So what’s the plan?

The first piece of news is we’ve reduced our hours at work to give the Kickstarter campaign our best shot, and so far it’s looking great!

We’ve refined the design of Tingbot, fine-tuned some of the hardware and built a fantastic IDE which means even a non-coder (like some of our team) can make awesome apps for Tingbot :)

In the last update we said we wanted to involve you in our development process, and we meant it. We’ve started loaning our (very few) prototypes to some of you to play with and we’ve been really impressed with what you’ve made so far. We’ll be sharing these and more exciting Tingbot updates with you in the run-up to the launch.

Hold on to your hats!
