'Tis the season to be jolly and we’re are tingling with excitement at the prospect of seeing the Tingbot go into production and delivering it to our backers.

We have just passed 75% funding with 25% of the time remaining so we’ll be doing everything we can to promote the Kickstarter campaign in the final week. **We need your help too, so please share the project far and wide to help us reach our goal!**


## Tingbot Vouchers

Perhaps some of you are thinking of giving a Pi as a present and are looking for add-ons. So, the Tingbot Crew have been thinking of how we could help!

We’ve decided to introduce Tingbot Vouchers for any backer who might be thinking of gifting a Tingbot to family or friends. If you’ve backed us already, just increase your pledge by the price of another Tingbot and we’ll send you a **personalised Tingbot Voucher** to give to that special someone :)

We’ll send out a survey after the campaign closes for you to give us all the details we need, and any special messages you’d like to include!

Lots of love,

*- The Tingbot Team*
