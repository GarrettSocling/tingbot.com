The **Tingbot Shoutout** reward is here!

We’ve just wrapped on our Tingbot Shoutout app - showcasing all our backers who pledged £1 or more.

Without you guys we just wouldn’t have hit our target. Through backing, sharing on Twitter/Facebook and your generosity towards our project we managed to reach a much larger audience than we could have on our own. We owe the project’s success to you!

So without further ado, head on over to [The Tingbot Ocean](//ocean.tingbot.com/), download the app and run it on [Tide](//github.com/tingbot/tide/releases).

For those on Windows (who don’t have access to Tide yet), fear not! We have a special recording of the app in action on the Tingbot Simulator below…

In case any of you missed the survey that was sent out at the start of the week, we have a little over 50 of you who have not chosen their Tingbot style yet. If you could respond as soon as possible it would really help us get an idea of how much material we need to order.

In the meantime we’ll be working away on Tingbot, Tide and getting production in full swing!

Cheers for now :)
