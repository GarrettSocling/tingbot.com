It’s here folks!

We’re launching the first version of **The Tingbot Ocean** - a place where you can share your Tingbot apps and download others that have been created by the Tingbot community.

**Check it out: [ocean.tingbot.com](//ocean.tingbot.com)**

As **everything is open-source**, feel free to modify any apps that you download and be sure to share the results. We’ve already uploaded some sample apps to get you started :)

We are really excited to see what you'll come up with!


## Get Making!

You don’t have to wait for your Tingbot to start making apps! If you haven’t already, [download the beta version of Tide](//github.com/tingbot/tide/releases) for Mac and check out our nifty [documentation](//tingbot-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Any apps that you make can be run in the Tingbot Simulator in Tide.

Tide for Windows is in the works - if you fancy getting involved with a fun open source project, get in touch!


## Made a Tingbot app?

Awesome! When you’re ready to share it with the world, send it through to **hello@tingbot.com** and we’ll post it on The Tingbot Ocean for all to see!


## One last request…

We need your help to make Tingbot a success, so **please keep sharing** the Kickstarter campaign with everyone you know. Your Twitter followers, Facebook friends, your neighbours, your postman - we need to reach as far and wide as possible to hit our target.

The sharing link is: [http://kck.st/1MBDys5](//kck.st/1MBDys5)

Thanks for all your messages of support and pledges so far, we really appreciate it and **we can't wait to try out your Tingbot apps!**
