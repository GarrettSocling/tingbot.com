Hello Tingbackers,

The Tingbot launch has been fantastic, and now we’re looking to the future!

So we’d like to ask a favour from you: to help us make Tingbot better, could you spare 5 minutes to give us your feedback?

As a wee added bonus for completing the questionnaire **you’ll be entered into the draw for a £50 Amazon voucher** to spend on whatever floats your boat.

Thanks for being a part of Tingbot!
