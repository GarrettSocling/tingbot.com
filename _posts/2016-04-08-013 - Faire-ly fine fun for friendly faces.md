## Howdy folks!

This is just a short update to say Tingbot is going to be at [Maker Faire UK in Newcastle](//www.makerfaireuk.com/makers/tingbot/) (23rd 24th April) and we’d love to see some friendly faces there.

It’s all well and good telling you about Tingbot via these updates, but we’re keen for you all to come and check it out in the flesh and have a play yourself!

This year at Maker Faire, we’re keen to ramp it up a gear and run demo slots where Joe will take you through Tide and how to make your own apps for Tingbot. We'll [tweet](//twitter.com/thetingbot) about the timings of these closer to the day.

We’re also keen to hear from those of you who might be keen to help develop Tide. We’ve made great headway and the Mac app is almost there but it would be particularly useful to get some input from Windows users.

Meanwhile, production is going well! Our injection moulder near Newcastle is busy tooling, orders have been made and board finalisations are with our electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen. We’re looking forward to sharing this with you and we’ll be in touch with a full update in the next few weeks :)

**See you at the Maker Faire!**
